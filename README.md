The form needs to contain the following fields:
•	Name*
•	Surname *
•	Email*
•	School*

Only the fields marked with a * are mandatory.

The school field needs to be a dropdown list, with the name of all the open schools included in the attached spreadsheet. 

Once registered a user needs to be able to log-in the portal and land on a welcome page.
